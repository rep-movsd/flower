# Syntax is RPN
# identifiers start with lowercase
# Operators start with caps, or symbols

# Define a "flow" of 4 points
square ( s 4 Point ) Flow      # s is 4 points (polar) at origin
p Point Decl                    # p is a Point
s p 45 i * / 4 i Each =           # / means rotate, Assign s[i] to p rotated by i * 45 degrees. Each is an operator to loop
s s 20 + =                   # + means add to points distance
EndFlow


# Every Flow is a set of data that gets transformed
# Flows are compiled to a pair of values for each parameter
# Animations can be done by modulating these values as a function of t in any fashion
